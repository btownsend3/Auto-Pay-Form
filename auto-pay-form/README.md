## How to use this program

Upon launching the application, a form will render on the screen. Choose from the top of the screen the option that best fits your payment scheduling needs. When the schedule type is selected, the form will finish rendering inputs as well as a submit button. After all fields are populated, clicking the submit button will render a populated payment slip. If necessary, the account to be paid can be specified for each individual payment on this screen. At this point, you can print the document.
